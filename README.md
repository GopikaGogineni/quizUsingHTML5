# quizUsingHTML5
The main idea of this project is to develop a quiz using HTML5 which is similar to GRE. It includes various questions related to listening, quant, verbal and so on. Once the user is done taking the quiz, he/she will be able to retrieve his scores. In order to implement this project we used several tags in HTML5. One of the interesting things was MathML library.
